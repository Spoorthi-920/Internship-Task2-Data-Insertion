# Task 2: Data Insertion and Handling Nulls

Step 1: For this task, I have created two tables - `department` and `employee`.
Step 2:  I inserted sample data into tables. 
Step 3: I carefully handled missing values by using `UPDATE` statements and applied default values where needed to keep the data clean and consistent. 
Step 4: I also removed redundant or unnecessary records using `DELETE` statements. 

Through this exercise, I practiced essential SQL operations like inserting, updating, and deleting data, while ensuring that the dataset remains accurate and well-organized.

**Tools Used:** SQLite / DB Fiddle  
**Deliverable:** `Task2_Data_Insertion_and_Nulls.sql`
